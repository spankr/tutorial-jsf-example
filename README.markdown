# JavaServer Faces Example

This is a simple maven project that utilizes JavaServer Faces to build a web application.
It is using [JSF 2.1](http://jsf-spec.java.net/) and Java EE6.

The goal here is to demonstrate what web development can be done with "out of the box" Java EE as most of my web development relies on [3rd party solutions](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) for its web framework.

If you find JSF interesting, I suggest taking a look at [Mojarra](https://javaserverfaces.java.net/), Oracle's open source implementation, [Apache MyFaces](https://myfaces.apache.org/) and [Mykong's examples](http://www.mkyong.com/tutorials/jsf-2-0-tutorials/).
